MFCC - Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients
MFCCs are a representation of the short-term power spectrum of a sound signal

MFCCs are widely used in audio processing because they effectively capture the timbral texture of sound, which is crucial for tasks like:

Speech Recognition: MFCCs capture the phonetic content of speech by representing how sound frequencies are distributed over time.
Speaker Recognition: The unique vocal tract characteristics of different speakers can be captured using MFCCs.
Emotion Recognition: Emotional states often affect the spectral properties of speech, and MFCCs can capture these changes.
Music Analysis: MFCCs are also used in music information retrieval for tasks like genre classification and music recommendation.
